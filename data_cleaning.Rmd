### 0. Set up
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = T)

# Load packages as needed
require_packages <- function(...) {
  
  libs_unlisted <- unlist(list(...))
  req_packages <- unlist(lapply(libs_unlisted, require, character.only = T))
  need_packages <- libs_unlisted[req_packages == F]
  
  if (length(need_packages) > 0) {
    install.packages(need_packages)
    lapply(need_packages, library, character.only = T)
  }
}

# Download and load required packages
require_packages("dplyr", "readr")
```


### 1. Load Data
```{r}
players <- read_csv("Data/Players_2023-24.csv")
east <- read_csv("Data/Teams_East_2023-24.csv")
west <- read_csv("Data/Teams_West_2023-24.csv")
```


### 2. Clean Data
```{r}
# Subsetting relevant stats
clean_players <- players %>% 
  select(PLAYER_ID, PLAYER_NAME, PLAYER_NAME, TEAM_ID, TEAM_ABBREVIATION, AGE, 
         GP, MIN, PTS, FGA, FG_PCT, FG3A, FG3_PCT, FTA, FT_PCT,
         OREB, DREB, REB, AST, TOV, STL, BLK, PF, PFD, PLUS_MINUS)

clean_east <- east %>% 
  select(TEAM_ID, TEAM_NAME, GP, W, L, W_PCT, 
         PTS, FGA, FG_PCT, FG3A, FG3_PCT, FTA, FT_PCT,
         OREB, DREB, REB, AST, TOV, STL, BLK, PF, PFD, PLUS_MINUS) %>% 
  mutate(CONFERENCE = "East")

clean_west <- west %>% 
  select(TEAM_ID, TEAM_NAME, GP, W, L, W_PCT, 
         PTS, FGA, FG_PCT, FG3A, FG3_PCT, FTA, FT_PCT,
         OREB, DREB, REB, AST, TOV, STL, BLK, PF, PFD, PLUS_MINUS) %>% 
  mutate(CONFERENCE = "West")

# Add team abbreviation 
clean_east <- clean_players %>% 
  select(TEAM_ID, TEAM_ABBREVIATION) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  right_join(clean_east)

clean_west <- clean_players %>% 
  select(TEAM_ID, TEAM_ABBREVIATION) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  right_join(clean_west)

clean_teams <- rbind(clean_east, clean_west)

# Add team full name
clean_players <- clean_teams %>% 
  select(CONFERENCE, TEAM_ID, TEAM_NAME) %>% 
  left_join(clean_players)
```


### 3. Save Data
```{r}
# Check if there are 30 franchises and write data
if (nrow(clean_teams) == 30) {
  write_csv(clean_east, "Clean/East_2023-24.csv")
  write_csv(clean_west, "Clean/West_2023-24.csv")
} else {
  print("There are more than 30 franchises in your teams data !!!")
}

if (length(unique(clean_players$TEAM_ID)) == 30) {
  write_csv(clean_players, "Clean/Players_2023-24.csv")
} else {
  print("There are more than 30 franchises in your players data !!!")
}
```
